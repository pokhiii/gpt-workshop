## Day 1: Understanding Generative Models (Basic Text Generation)

**Goal: Introduce participants to generative models using a simple Markov Chain or RNN-based text generator.**

- **Concepts:**
    - What is a generative model?
    - How does a simple text generator work?
    - Hands-on:
    - Code a simple character-level or word-level generator in Python using a basic statistical model.
    - Train it on a small corpus (e.g., famous quotes, song lyrics, or books).
